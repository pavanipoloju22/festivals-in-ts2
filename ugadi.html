   <p>Ugadi marks the commencement of the Hindu New Year and is observed in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, and Goa in India. The terms Yugadi or Ugadi stem from the Sanskrit words 'yuga' (age) and 'adi' (beginning), denoting ‘the start of a new age’. Typically falling in late March or early April in the Gregorian calendar, this day holds historical and cultural significance for Hindus. Celebrated under different names such as Gudi Padwa in Maharashtra, Ugadi in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, and Yugadi in Karnataka, it is a time-honoured tradition. Traditions on this day include creating colourful floor patterns like Muggulu or Rangoli, adorning doors with mango leaves known as torana, exchanging gifts, offering charity, indulging in oil massages and ceremonial baths, preparing and sharing a special dish called pachadi, and visiting Hindu temples. Pachadi, with its blend of six flavours, symbolises embracing all aspects of life in the upcoming year according to Telugu and Kannada Hindu customs.

   <p>The term Ugadi derived from the word Yugadi. Primarily, the term Yugadi is the combination of two great words: Yuga, which means age or period; and Adi, which means the beginning of something. Therefore, Ugadi literally means the origination of New Year. The festival carries a greater amount of significance for people who celebrate this festival to recognize the work of Lord Brahma. The Lord is entrusted to be the creator of ages and is adulated on the day of the festival.</p>

   <p>The word "Ugadi" is a combination of two words — "Yuga" (age) and "Adi" (beginning). An auspicious occasion, the day is celebrated with much pomp and gusto. People from every sphere of the society enjoy the day by wearing new clothes and gorging on delicious delicacies. Prayers are offered in temples to welcome the new year while people clean their homes and decorate them with Rangolis—a traditional way to decorate floors by creating various patterns with coloured rice or flower petals.</p>
